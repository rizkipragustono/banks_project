# Automated Top 10 Largest Banks Report by Market Capitalization
## Project Description:
I developed an automated system for a research organization to generate quarterly reports on the worldâ€™s top 10 largest banks by market capitalization. The system compiles bank data in USD, converts it into GBP, EUR, and INR using quarterly exchange rates from a CSV file, and stores the results in both CSV and database formats. This solution ensures consistent, accurate, and efficient reporting every quarter.

You can find the required data on this webpage https://web.archive.org/web/20230908091635/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_banks.

And you can find the exchange rate file here https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMSkillsNetwork-PY0221EN-Coursera/labs/v2/exchange_rate.csv.
